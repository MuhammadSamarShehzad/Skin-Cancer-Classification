    'Melanoma': (
        "Melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer that originates in melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells. "
        "It is aggressive and can spread rapidly, but early detection and treatment greatly improve outcomes."
    ),
    'Vascular Lesion': (
        "Vascular lesions are abnormalities of blood vessels that may appear as red or purple marks on the skin. "
        "They are typically benign and include conditions like hemangiomas and spider veins."
    ),
    'Actinic Keratosis': (
        "Actinic keratosis is a rough, scaly patch caused by long-term sun exposure. "
        "It is considered precancerous and can potentially develop into squamous cell carcinoma if untreated."
    ),
    'Squamous Cell Carcinoma': (
        "Squamous cell carcinoma is a common skin cancer arising from the squamous cells of the epidermis. "
        "It often presents as a persistent sore or scaly red patch, particularly in sun-exposed areas."
    ),
    'Basal Cell Carcinoma': (
        "Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer, typically appearing as a pearly or translucent bump. "
        "While it grows slowly and rarely spreads, prompt treatment is necessary to prevent deeper tissue damage."
    ),
    'Seborrheic Keratosis': (
        "Seborrheic keratosis is a benign skin growth with a waxy or scaly appearance. "
        "These lesions are harmless and commonly appear with aging, requiring no treatment unless symptomatic."
    ),
    'Dermatofibroma': (
        "Dermatofibroma is a benign, fibrous nodule often found on the lower legs. "
        "It is firm and slightly raised, usually painless, and requires no treatment unless for cosmetic reasons."
    ),
    'Nevus': (
        "A nevus, or mole, is a benign growth of melanocytes. "
        "While most moles are harmless, changes in size, shape, or color should be evaluated to rule out melanoma."
